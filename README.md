Project Description

This project is a web-based Aura Calculator that lets users record daily aura-related activities, track their total aura score, and visualize results through interactive charts.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

It solves the urgent problem of not knowing if your aura is glowing or just buffering, while tracking how many auras you‚Äôve lost or gained and showing your current vibe status.


The Solution (that nobody asked for)

This project makes aura tracking fun and easy! Just answer quick, playful questions about your day ("Did you help someone?" +50 points, "Argue with a coworker?" -30 points). The more experiences you log, the smarter it gets‚Äîcomparing your vibes against others and even celebrity aura champs. Get instant results like "Sunshine Superstar" or "Needs More Coffee," with tips to boost your energy. It's like a game that actually improves your mood.
